1) Do not make assumptions.
2) Think outside the box. "Really" do this. One way is to challange assumed assumptions (personal example: my pre- and post-increment confusion.)
3) If a PR comment looks blatantly wrong, go to item#1 and respond in person, not on the public thread.
4) Self leaders challange assumed constraints, activate their points of power and are proactive about getting what they need to succeed.(1)
5) The two most powerful words to get what you need to succeed are "I NEED".(1)
6) Empowerement is something someone gives you. Self leadership is what you do to make it work.(1)
